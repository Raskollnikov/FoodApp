three months ago, I developed a basic website called "LafshaEats." This project served as a starting point for my journey into web development and React. It was designed to be simple and beginner-friendly, providing me with a foundation to learn and experiment with web technologies.

As I continued to grow and enhance my skills in React, I decided to create a more advanced project, a FoodApp, from the ground up. This endeavor was a bit more challenging but incredibly rewarding. In the process, I acquired a deeper understanding of various tools and technologies, including: tailwind,RTK, react-router,testing library,react-icons etc...
Throughout this project, I not only honed my technical skills but also improved my ability to write clear, concise, and engaging code. The result was a more polished and professional application with a user-friendly interface. This experience was an important step in my journey as a developer, and I'm excited to continue learning and refining my skills.
